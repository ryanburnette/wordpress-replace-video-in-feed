# wordpress-replace-video-in-feed

## In Development

This is a work in progress.

## Rationale

I'm using RSS feeds to generate content for email campaigns and the WordPress-generated
RSS feeds contain `iframe` embed code for videos embedded in content. This isn't how
I want to add videos to emails. The goal of this plugin is to replace the `iframe`
embed with the video thumbnail and a link to play the video to keep the emails
generated from the feed working properly.
